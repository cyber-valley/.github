## Why

We live in an amazing time when people, tech, and nature can work together for the betterment of our planet and civilization.

But unfortunately, everything is happening the other way around.

The scope of the problem is so complex that building from scratch feels like the only way to go.

We plan to redesign all fundamental processes symbiotically, while also fixing our consumer culture and habits along the way.

We have the ability to harness clean energy. We want to eat nutrient rich food. We need to have clean and calm environment. We wish our children to have personal development path. We love watching stars every day.

There is still so much that the greedy and selfish civilization has taken. All we do, must add to the planet, not exploit it.

So we have decided to reclaim responsibility for our future to create a happier, longer, and more fulfilling life.
